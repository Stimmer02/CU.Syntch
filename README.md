This is my Bachelor thesis project that aims at comparing simple audio processing between GPU and CPU implementation.

To run it you need to have PulseAudio server running on your Linux device.

(Source files are included on other branches like CPU-V3 or GPU)

NOTICE:
This project is only a proof of concept. I do not take any responsibility of potential risks associated with using this software.
